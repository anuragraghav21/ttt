# Frequency Count

Project is based on Django framework.

Materialize framework is used for the frontend part whereas backend part is done on Django REST Framework.''

urllib.request library is used in python to extract the text from hosted file.

After the extraction, words along with their counts are stored and sorted to get the most frequent 'n' words available.

For e.g., 

The most frequent word is 'I' whose count is 27.
For n=3, result is [['I', 27], ['a', 24], ['to', 22]]
